- We have one error when validating with an input tag inside of an a tag. Could not find a solution for this at the time.
- Edit.html may not work when you have an uploaded image.
- the HTML files may have a little bit of white space which I am not sure how to fix
- All the minimized files are in a folder called dist

- When deleting, you may have to press the button multiple times before it deletes.
- When editing a habit, you may have to retry it a couple times before it retrieves the correct habit to be edited.
- When clicking the thumbs up, it may take multiple tries to update.
- To turn off the notifications, just click the gear and an alert box will pop up. As for the notification solution,
  push notifications would have been hard for a web app and not everyone would have this application opened all the
  time. We settled for a notification that on the first login of the day for the user, a notification would appear
  to remind the user of the habits they have to update. Email notifications is another notification option we are
  looking into.
