- When deleting, you may have to press the button multiple times before it deletes.
- When editing a habit, you may have to retry it a couple times before it retrieves the correct habit to be edited.
When clicking the thumbs up, it may take multiple tries to update.
- There are daily notifications the user receives at the first login of the day that tells the user of the habits 
  they need to update. There is however a bug where the new login time is not saved after the notification is 
  displayed. And the nofication will constantly appear at every page you visit. It can be resolved by logging out and 
  logging back in.
- To turn on and off notifications, there is a gear icon that will notify the user if they want to turn on or off.
